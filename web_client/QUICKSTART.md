# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the Claude Agent Web Client in 4 simple steps!

## Step 1: Start the API Server

In a terminal, navigate to the api_server directory and start the server:

```bash
cd /path/to/claude-agent-sdk-python/api_server
python -m uvicorn src.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

You should see output like:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

**Important**: The server includes CORS middleware to allow web browser access. If you previously started the server, please restart it to pick up the CORS configuration.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

In a new terminal, navigate to the web_client directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd web_client
npm install
```

## Step 3: Start the Web Client

Start the Vite development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v7.1.12  ready in XXX ms

  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:8080/

- Check that the URL is `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (not https, not localhost)
- Look at the browser console (F12) for error details

### Can't Access Web Client?
- Make sure `serve.py` is running (Step 2)
- Try a different port: `python serve.py 3000`
- Check if another application is using port 8080

### Messages Not Sending?
- Check the connection status (should show green dot)
- Refresh the page and reconnect
- Verify the API server is still running
