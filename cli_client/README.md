/workspace $ cd folder

/workspace/folder $ pwd

```

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- httpx (for shell_client.py)
- aiohttp (for client.py)

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install httpx aiohttp
```

## API Modes

Both clients support invocations API mode, where all requests are routed through a single `/invocations` endpoint. The shell client exclusively uses invocations mode for all operations.

## Server Logs

When using invocations mode, the server logs each forwarded request:
```
ðŸ”€ Invocation â†’ POST /shell/execute
ðŸ”€ Invocation â†’ GET /shell/cwd
```
